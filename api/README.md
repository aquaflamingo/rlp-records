# RLP Records Django API

This is the backend Django API that stores information related to the RLP Records application

## Getting Started
### Requirements
The application uses `pyacoustid` to perform fingerprinting via `chromaprint` library. This requires some pre work to get associated `dyllib`s available:

See https://pypi.org/project/pyacoustid/

> First, install the Chromaprint fingerprinting library by Lukas Lalinsky. (The library itself depends on an FFT library, but itâ€™s smart enough to use an algorithm from software you probably already have installed; see the Chromaprint page for details.) This module can use either the Chromaprint dynamic library or the fpcalc command-line tool, which itself depends on libavcodec. If you use fpcalc, either ensure that it is on your $PATH or set the FPCALC environment variable to its location.

### Steps
Initialize your virtual environment if you have not already done so:
```bash
python -m venv venv

. venv/bin/activate
```

Install requirements from `requirements.txt`

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You can then run the server via:
```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

## Fixtures
There re two default fixtures present in the `Fixtures` folder  for a record and record label you can load them via Makefile commands
